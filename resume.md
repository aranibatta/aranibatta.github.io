You're here because you wanted some more information on what I've been up to. If you're looking for a quick (but maybe outdated) overview, you'll want to take a look at my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb0dnqqhgaiv7ku/arani-resume-2016.pdf?dl=0) and my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aranibatta). If you're looking for all the goods, I'd figure my [cv](/fullcv) is right for you! If you feel like there's something you'd like to ask me about, something doesn't look quite right, or you'd just like to chat I'd love to get an [email](mailto:aranibatta@berkeley.edu) from you!
