A while back, I wrote a short essay for my students on the FRC Team that I mentor, 5499 BHS Robotics, on whether the team should place focus on breaching outer works in the 2016 game. If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about, you should check out [FIRST](http://firstinspires.org). I did a bit of analyis on the statistics of previous years and an historical layout on how similar games were played and the insights we could take away from that.
