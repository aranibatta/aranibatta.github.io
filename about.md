If you met me before June of 2014, you probably know me as Arani Bhattacharyay. If you met me afterwards, I probably introduced myself as Ron Bhatta. If you know me as both, you probably know me fairly well and can skip the following. 

Past
------

Both Arani and Ron were born in Kolkata, West Bengal on the later portion of 1996, but Ron would mold into existence later . (Ha, you thought they'd give you THAT much personal info) They were born to Dhruba Bhattacharyay, a Civil Engineer and Project Manager who'd finished his graduate studies at [The Univeristy of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) and Saswati Basu (she'd already wrapped up a masters in Political Science from [Calcutta University Lady Brabourne](http://www.ladybrabourne.com/)). Dhruba worked for Taisei at the time, so he and his family hopped around living in various Southeast Asian states for a few years. Somewhere in between, Arani got a brother his parents dubbed [Shubhayu](https://www.facebook.com/shubhayu.bhattacharyay).
