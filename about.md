If you met me before June of 2014, you probably know me as Arani Bhattacharyay. If you met me afterwards, I probably introduced myself as Ron Bhatta. If you know me as both, you probably know me fairly well and can skip the following. 

I hate talking about myself, but I hate others speaking incorrectly of me more. So this shall be my feeble attempt to lay out my own history, who I am, and what I like before someone beats me to it. Public perception of me is for you to judge. I'll also try and include some more embarrasing photographs of myself for entertainment value. Let's get started!

#Past

Both Arani and Ron were born in Kolkata, West Bengal on the later portion of 1996, but Ron would later mold into existence. (Ha, you thought they'd give you THAT much personal info) They were born to Dhruba Bhattacharyay, a Civil Engineer and Project Manager who'd finished his graduate studies at [The Univeristy of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) and Saswati Basu (she'd already wrapped up a masters in Political Science from [Calcutta University Lady Brabourne](http://www.ladybrabourne.com/)). Dhruba worked for Taisei at the time, so he and his family hopped around living in various Southeast Asian states for a few years. Somewhere in between, Arani got a brother his parents dubbed [Shubhayu](https://www.facebook.com/shubhayu.bhattacharyay).

Around 1999, the Bhattacharyays began moving to the United States as dad decided to get an MBA out of UC Irvine, but the events of 2001 on the personal and global scale prevented permanent relocation until December of that year. At this point, we'd moved to the South Bay in Los Angeles, where I'd pretty much spend the rest of my childhood. Arani's elementary years were quite uneventful. Imagine a chubby little indian tyke that by all acounts was soft at heart but annoying. This kid was also a fairly average student, an avid reader, and for around two years (You'd be surprised which two) convinced he was a squirrel. 

Arani's story gets a tad more interesting as he moved on to middle school. Where most find social struggles and

Many of those interests carried on as he moved on to Mira Costa High School. His involvement in the FIRST Lego League translated over to joining the local FIRST Robotics Team 294. 294 had just come off a world-championship winning season, so least to say the four years in terms of performance were a little dissapointing, but most would'nt complaing about three regional finalists and a regional win. The robotics team became one of Arani's more significant social cirlces, and the first serious experience in such a high intensity environment.

So that's me up to [today](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/07/investing/stocks-markets-dow-china/). I might feel compelled to update it, I as likeley will not. Yes, I repeatedly change the pronouns and the perspective of the writer. Stop being my english teacher and deal with it. (I love you Mr. Zeoli)

So I leave you with this picture of an air guitar playing bear in front of a much cooler guitar playing bear.
