If you met me before June of 2014, you probably know me as Arani Bhattacharyay. If you met me afterwards, I probably introduced myself as Ron Bhatta. If you know me as both, you probably know me fairly well and can skip the following. 

I hate talking about myself, but I hate others speaking incorrectly of me more. So this shall be my feeble attempt to lay out my own history, who I am, and what I like before someone beats me to it. Public perception of me is for you to judge. I'll also try and include some more embarrasing photographs of myself for entertainment value. Let's get started!

#Past

Both Arani and Ron were born in Kolkata, West Bengal on the later portion of 1996, but Ron would mold into existence later . (Ha, you thought they'd give you THAT much personal info) They were born to Dhruba Bhattacharyay, a Civil Engineer and Project Manager who'd finished his graduate studies at [The Univeristy of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) and Saswati Basu (she'd already wrapped up a masters in Political Science from [Calcutta University Lady Brabourne](http://www.ladybrabourne.com/)). Dhruba worked for Taisei at the time, so he and his family hopped around living in various Southeast Asian states for a few years. Somewhere in between, Arani got a brother his parents dubbed [Shubhayu](https://www.facebook.com/shubhayu.bhattacharyay).

Around 1999, the Bhattacharyays began moving to the United States as dad decided to get an MBA out of UC Irvine, but the events of 2001 on the personal and global scale prevented permanent relocation until December of that year. At this point, we'd moved to the South Bay in Los Angeles, where I'd pretty much spend the rest of my childhood. Arani's elementary years were quite uneventful. Imagine a chubby little indian tyke that by all acounts was soft at heart but annoying. This kid was also a fairly average student, an avid reader, and for around two years (you'd be surprised which two) convinced he was a squirrel. 

Arani's story gets a tad more interesting as he moved on to middle school. Where most find social struggles and pressue from those around them, Arani was oblivious enough for all of that to fly over his head. He began to somewhat pay attention in school, and his grades improved likewise. I had my fair share of problems though, dealing with cleptomania and my relationship with family. In school, he helped start the MBMS Science Olympiad program, which became consistently ranked in the top ten at the state level by the end of his tenure. He also got inolved with the local FIRST Lego League program, which one its regional his second year and had two state championship visits. Outside of school, I loved failing at rec sports.

Many of those interests carried on as Arani moved on to Mira Costa High School. His involvement in the FIRST Lego League translated over to joining the local FIRST Robotics Team 294. 294 had just come off a world-championship winning season, so least to say the four years in terms of performance were a little dissapointing, but most would'nt complaing about three regional finalists and a regional win. The robotics team became one of Arani's more significant social cirlces, and the first serious experience in such a high intensity environment. Arani accredits his interest in software and electronics to have been born as a part of this program, and believes he owes any future success in technology to the team itself.


After taking a semester class as an introduction to Model UN, Arani auditioned and joined the nationally ranked (consistently #1 or #2) Mira Costa Model United Nations program. As a part of the program, Arani competed for Mira Costa at RHSMUN 2011, RHSMUN 2012 (both Outsanding Delegations), the nationally acclaimed ILMUNC 2013 (Best Delegation), and ended his career rather early at WMHSMUN 2013. Arani, by Mira Costa standards, was a very slightly above average delegate, but his focus in MUN was learning rather than competing. This organization made up a large part of his social construct in high school, and is the most fraternal environment he'd been in at this time. "It was an Honor to be a part of Mira Costa Model UN."

Arani was also involved in a whole slew of clubs, the most significant being Mira Costa Science Olympiad. The team was founded in 2010, but in its first two years struggled to compete at a high level. Arani joined his freshman year, and would move up eventually to become President from 2013-2014. In his last three years, the team moved into ranking highly at the regional and having a fair showing at the state level.

If I were you, I'd be a bit bored with all the Arani self-appreciation. First of all, I'm flattered you've made it this far. So I'll present you with the beginnings of Ron Bhatta. The second semester of my senior year, the AP Government class was split up into five groups which ran mock campaigns to run for president. I acted as the canidate for my group, and in an effort to americanize my name, I became Ron Bhatta, a Libertartian Governor from Michigan. (much love to Andrew Pasterczyk, Julia Arciga, and Sahir Deepak) The campaign was extremely succesful, and the name grew traction. Around the same time, I somehow found myself on prom court, and as my luck would have it I shattered both of my wrists in an extremely misgivnig event four days before prom. I scheduled my surgery afterwards, but was forced to miss the rest of school that year. From what I understand, a few juniors found much amusement to my becoming, and the name Ron Bhatta rang as a term of sophomoric endearment. Come prom, I showed up with two casts and an appropriate vicadin high, chaperoned by friend the entire night (Koh Shoda), and later carried on the dance floor by Hannah Daly after we won Prom King and Queen. I decided to live by the goodbye my school gave me, and adopted the name Ron Bhatta.

As is common with persons such as me, I was an absolute mess in the girl department (story for another day), and had a small but fluid social circle.

Ron elected to take the Regent's and Chancellor's Scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley and joined the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. I quickly realized that my strengths laid on my ability to get things done on my accord (often outside of school), and kept myself busy as such. In my time at Berkeley, I've been involved with The Daily Californian, Hackers @ Berkeley, Build Berkeley, Statnews, and the Tele-immersion group in CITRIS. Outside of school, I love exploring The City, performing stand-up, going to concerts, and one on one time with friends.

I also kept involved with Model United Nations on the staff of IMUNA's National High School Model United Nations (NHSMUN). It was the largest High School MUN conference to date, and put on completely my college students. I was an Assistant Director on the Administraive Affairs team, which handled much of the background business in running the conference successfully. It was the craziest week of my life.

I like attending Hackathons. I've met some amazing people through them (including a current roommate!), and excited to meet more. My favorites so far have been PennApps, Calhacks, and MHacks, but I'm trying to attend smaller venues in the future! My current professional interests lie in Product Management, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Statistics. I'll take a good stand-up gig if I can get it. 

So that's me up to [today](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/07/investing/stocks-markets-dow-china/). I might feel compelled to update it, I as likeley will not. Yes, I repeatedly change the pronouns and the perspective of the writer. Stop being my english teacher and deal with it. (I love you Mr. Zeoli)

#Likings

Ron likes quite a many things. First and foremost, his sports fandom lies loyal to the California Golden Bears (Go Bears!). At the professional level, I'm loyal to Los Angeles. Go Clippers, Dodgers, and Kings! For some reason, I do like some Boston teams, but especially die hard for the Patriots! I'll give the Lakers, Red Sox, and Raiders a nod too. I love to catch games when given a chance.

Arani has very particular tastes when it comes to comdey. He really appreciates musical parody, and the Lonely Island, Weird Al, and Lil Dicky do it best. Classic Collegehumor and Whitest Kids You Know are definately underappreciated. In terms of stand-up he prefers more material and a story-teller style, from the likes of Aziz Ansari, John Mulaney, Anthony Jesselink, and Kumail Nanjiani.

I have fairly strong beliefs about startups. The current economic model for funding and sustenance is un-justifiable. In practice, many miss the point of starting such organizations, fail to produce something meaningful or provide value, and get caught up in SV antics. People begin to believe entrepreneurship is a career and not a trait. In theory, they're an amazingly powerful concept that keep modern innovation running.

I have no strict beliefs in terms of politics, but I'm told I lean a bit left. I like having conversations about world events and politics, but constructive ones based in facts and not opiniative arguments. Those are really hard to find.

It's commonly understood that I'm an old soul amongst people who known me, and that shows in my music tastes. I'm currently obsessed with Father John Misty and George Ezra. I'm also inclined towards Billy Joel, Louis Armstrong, The Beatles, Queen, Mumford and Sons, G-Eazy, Graduation by Kanye West, The Smiths, Big Star, Otis Redding, Passenger, Passion Pit, and a bit of country. I love listening to new music too!

That's what I like, and if you feel me at all, let me know! I like it when people reach out. So reach out, and I'll always respond!

I leave you with this picture of an air-guitar playing bear in front of a much cooler guitar playing bear.

Enjoi.
