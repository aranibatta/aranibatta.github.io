    "summary": "Currently a second year studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I like the colors of the school's I've been too, I'm not a huge fan of complicated UIs, and I heart random stats. In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, reading fivethirtyeight, performing some stand-up on the side, blowing money at music festivals, and laughing at horrendously written television (think White Collar).",
