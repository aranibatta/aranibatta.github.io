Hi, I'm Arani Bhattacharyay.
------

Feel free to use this site to learn a bit more [about](http://arani.io/about) me, efficiently scrape my [professional history](https://drive.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/file/d/0BzdGCwU1D9LTOWc2ZnRzTGNXU1E/view?usp=sharing), or amuse yourself to my [musings](http://deeker.io). 

Junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu). Currently working on [Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io/), [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/), and [The Greybots](http://harambabes.com/). Formerly lead mentor and drive coach of FRC Team 5499, [The Sloth Bears](http://bhsrobotics.org/), and engineering with [Google](http://google.com), [NetApp](http://netapp.com), and [Boeing](http://boeing.com).

In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, running berries in Killer Queen, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, "reading" [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), performing some stand-up on the side, blowing money at music festivals, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)). Whenever (not so) divine inspiration hits me, I'll blurb out some thoughts on this page, and if they're any good I'l put them on [medium](https://medium.com/@aranibatta). [Reach out](mailto:aranibatta@berkeley.edu) for anything!
