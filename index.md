Hi, I'm arani bhattacharyay.
------

Feel free to use this site to learn a bit more [about](http://personal.aranibatta.com) me. I'll write stuff, and if it's useful to others it'll go [here](http://blog.bhattacharyay.com).

Currently working on a NewCo. Studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu). 

Formerly taught as lead technical mentor and drive coach of World Champion FRC Team 5499, [The Bay Orangutans](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5499/history), built [StartupSift](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/startupsift), organized [Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io/), and ran [Hackers at Berkeley](https://hackersatberkeley.com). Previously engineering with [Zenreach](http://zenreach.com), [Google](http://google.com), [NetApp](http://netapp.com), and [Boeing](http://boeing.com).

In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, running berries in Killer Queen, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, [boogie boarding](https://getpocket.com/@aranibatta) the internet, performing some stand-up on the side, struggling to choose between 350s and 4s in the morning, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)). 

[Reach out](https://t.me/aranibatta) if there's a non-zero chance I can be helpful!
