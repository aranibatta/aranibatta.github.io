Hi, I'm Arani Bhattacharyay.
------


I'm currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I like the colors of the school's I've been too, I'm not a huge fan of [complicated UIs](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), and I heart random stats. Outside of keeping the org alive, I teach and run workshops for [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). I run workshops and mentorhsip for [Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io/), the largest hackathon west of the Mississippi. You might also know me as the lead mentor and drive coach of FRC Team 5499, [The Sloth Bears](http://team5499.com/).


In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, running berries in Killer Queen, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, "reading" [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), performing some stand-up on the side, blowing money at music festivals, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)). Whenever (not so) divine inspiration hits me, I'll blurb out some thoughts on this page, and if they're any good I'l put them on [medium](https://medium.com/@aranibatta). Feel free to use this site to learn a bit more [about](http://arani.io/about) me, efficiently scrape my [professional history](http://arani.io/cv), or amuse yourself with my [musings](http://arani.io/thoughts). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:arani@arani.io) for anything!
