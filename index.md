#Hi, I'm Arani Bhattacharyay.

I'm currently a second year studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I like the colors of the school's I've been too, I'm not a huge fan of complicated UIs, and I heart random stats. I teach and run workshops for [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). I'm in charge of ops for [Build Berkeley](http://buildberkeley.com/), Berkeley's new social good hackathon in the spring. I'm also an undergraduate researcher in [Laurent El Ghaoui's](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/) machine learning group, [StatNews](http://statnews.org/).

In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, "reading" [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), performing some stand-up on the side, blowing money at music festivals, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)). Whenever (not so) divine inspiration hits me, I'll blurb out some thoughts on this page, and if they're any good I'l put them on [medium](https://medium.com/@aranibatta). Feel free to use this site to learn a bit more [about](http://arani.io/about) me, efficiently scrape my [professional history](http://arani.io/cv), or amuse yourself with my [musings](http://arani.io/thoughts). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:arani@arani.io) for anything!
