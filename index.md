Hi, I'm arani bhattacharyay.
------

Feel free to use this site to learn a bit more [about](https://www.notion.so/bhattacharyay/arani-bhattacharyay-8ced3f678a99479a968f33fa2b93f4bd) me.

Currently working on a NewCo. Studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu). 

Formerly lead technical mentor and drive coach of World Champion FRC Team 5499, [The Bay Orangutans](http://team5499.org/), built [StartupSift](http://startupsift.com), organized [Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io/), and ran [Hackers at Berkeley](https://hackersatberkeley.com). Previously engineering with [Zenreach](http://zenreach.com), [Google](http://google.com), [NetApp](http://netapp.com), and [Boeing](http://boeing.com).

In my free time I enjoy fiddling with guitars, running berries in Killer Queen, cooking poorly, pretending to work out, "reading" [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), performing some stand-up on the side, struggling to choose between 350s and 4s in the morning, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)). 

Whenever (not so) divine inspiration hits me, I'll blurb out some thoughts on this [page](http://blog.bhattacharyay.com), and if they're any good I'll put them on [medium](https://medium.com/@aranibatta). [Reach out](https://keybase.io/arani) if there's a non-zero chance I can be helpful!
